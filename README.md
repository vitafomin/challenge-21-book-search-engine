# challenge-21-book-search-engine

## Description

In this weeks challenge I was tasked to refactor a fully functioning code that used RESTful API, to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. In the book search engine the user is able to search for books under the "Search for books" tab. The user has an option to login or sighn up. Doing this will allow the user to save any books that they search. This option is not availible for users that are not sighned in. Once logged in the when a book is searched. The user has an option to save it. The books that were saved are able to be located under the tab "Saved Books". When the user clicks on the "Saved Books" tab, they are able to see all the books that they have saved. The saved books that the user has, they are able to delete the book whenever they desire. The user can simply click "Delete Book" and the book will no longer appear in their "Saved Books" tab. Once the user is done saving and/ or deleting books, they are able to logout, they can do this by clicking the logout button in the top right corner.

## Installation

For this application to work successfully, you will need to have mongoose, json web token, apollo, graphQl, react, express, and bcrypt installed.
  

## Usage

This is a great application for any and every user. It is a convinient tool to allow anyone to search for books and save them to remember them for later. It  is a great stroage tool for the user to keep track of all the books that they wish to read, and delete any books that they have already read or have lost interest in.
